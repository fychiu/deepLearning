The codes are written for projects and practice






Modules:

dnn.py:

    Inludes layer module and dnn module
    
    The dnn module has several optimization functions:
    
        Reference(I): http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/
        The websites states the function and theory of each optimization algorithm
        
        Reference(II): http://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/updates.html
        The Lasagne Library gives me the examples of implementation
        Also the websites briefly describe the mathematic equations of algorithms
        
        
    HiddenLayer:
    
        Reference(I): http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/mlp.html
        The example of theano let me know more clear about how a module of DNN
        should be implemented
    

attenBased.py:

    Implement the attention-based mechanism structure of Google's paper
    Teaching Machine ot Read and Comprehend
